            <p>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a

                our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come
                from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the
                skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their
                magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with
                each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>
            <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
                skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and
                music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

            <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with
                free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health
                insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are
                flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as
                a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
